### Projects

`NC-DE-DataBakers`

My latest project involved `Python`, `YAML`, `PostgreSQL`, `AWS`, `Terraform`. Following ETL, data was extracted from a hosted database with credentials, this was uploaded to a AWS S3 bucket, to then be pulled and transformed into star schema tables and converted to parquet format. Finally the data was uploaded into a final AWS S3 bucket. This entire project was written to be automatically deployed using AWS lambdas and terraform automation with CloudWatch alerts. 

<br>

`python-sql-pg8000`

This project involved writing SQL code ranging from fundamental querying to advanced SQL such as UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, WINDOWING, Conditional Expressions and COALESCE. PSQL was integrated via `pg8000` module and functions were written with Python using a TDD approach.

<br>

`SQL-Data-Normalisation`

This project invovles writing SQL code to refactor and normalise the data without mutating original data. Further code is written to transform to star schema.
