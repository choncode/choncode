### Projects

My latest project `NC-DE-DataBakers` involved `Python`, `YAML`, `PostgreSQL`, `AWS`, `Terraform`. Following ETL, data was extracted from a hosted database with credentials, this was uploaded to a AWS S3 bucket, to then be pulled and transformed into star schema tables and converted to parquet format. Finally the data was uploaded into a final AWS S3 bucket. This entire project was written to be automatically deployed using AWS lambdas and terraform automation with CloudWatch alerts.
